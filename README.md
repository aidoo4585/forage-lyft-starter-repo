# Lyft Back-End Engineer Virtual Experience Project
Particiapted in a virtual experience offered by Lyft which emulates working as a Back-End Engineer at Lyft within a larger team made up of software engineering, product, data science, analytics and operations.
In the assigned project my team is responsible for Lyft Rentals. Lyft 
Rentals provides vehicles for riders who are looking to rent a vehicle for personal use such as a weekend vacation.
Throughout the program I tookover an unfinished project in Python to:
1. Come up with a clean design for an existing, unfinished component
2. Refactor a messy codebase
3. Write unit tests for your newly refactored system
4. Add new functionality to a system using Test-Driven Development

Below is the UML diagram I constructed for the proposed system.
